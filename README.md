# Word-Guess-Game-
The computer picks a random letter and the player has to guess the number by selecting a letter on the keyboard. If the player, does not select the correct letter, a point is given to the computer. If the user selects the correct letter, a point is given to the player. The user has 9 tries to get the correct letter. 

First I created the HTML skeleton and added the header <h1 The Psychic game></h1>
Then the body of the game to display Wins, Losses, Guesses Left and Gusses so far. 
Then I linked the html sctipt to the Javascript and css. 
Next, in the Javascript I wrote down all the possible options for the computer by creating the array and varribles. 
Next I created a function when a player selects a letter it will display 
The I created a variable for the computer to select a random letter from the availble choices in the array 
Then I created if/else statements. If the user selects the same letter has the computer, if the player gusses the wrong letter, the computer gets a point
Then the game resets after 9 rounds.
